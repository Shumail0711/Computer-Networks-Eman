        The first major cyber attack on the internet came courtesy of Cornell grad student Robert Morris. The “Morris Worm” struck in the year before the World Wide Web debuted, back when the internet was primarily the domain of academic researchers.
      </p>
      <h2>Company hacked in 2019!</h2>
      <p>
        Facebook, December 19, 2019. Security expert Bob Diachenko discovered that a database containing personal information of more than 267 million Facebook users had been left exposed. The exposed data included names, phone numbers, and Facebook IDs. Hackers in Vietnam are believed to be responsible.

        <li>They may exist with similar company names</li>
        <li>
          Finance & Insurance. Companies in the financial services industry were some of the earliest to implement fraud detection as a core element of their workflow. Unfortunately, the banks, lenders and insurance companies have also been the source for some of the largest data breaches to date.

      <p>As studied many more reports are generated over this kind of attacks.</p>
      <h3>What is a cyber attack?</h3>
      <p>
        A cyber attack is an assault launched by cybercriminals using one or more computers against a single or multiple computers or networks. A cyber attack can maliciously disable computers, steal data, or use a breached computer as a launch point for other attacks.
      </p>
      <h3>What are cyberthreats? </h3>
      <p>
        Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through a system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service.for example":
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Malware Attack</li>
        <li>Social Engineering Attack</li>
        <li>Pasword Attacks</li>
        <li>Software Supply Chain Attacks</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to avoid these kind of attacks?</h3>
      <p>
        Putting your network behind a firewall is one of the most effective ways to defend yourself from any cyber attack. A firewall system will block any brute force attacks made on your network and/or systems before it can do any damage, something we can help you with.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Steps to follow:</h4>
        <li>Creating a cyber security strategy.</li>
        <li>Conducting a security risk assessment.</li>
        <li>Hiring a virtual CISO service.</li>
        <li>Performing vulnerability assessments.</li>
        <li>Conducting employee phishing campaigns.</li>
        <li>Developing cyber security policies.</li>
        <li>Implementing security awareness training</li>
        
      </ul>

      <h3>Attacks Detected! </h3>
      <p>
        The firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) of these systems help cyber-security experts detect unauthorized transactions within the network . IDSs can be examined under three headings as exploitation detection, anomaly detection, and hybrid systems according to their working methods.

    <h3>Damage caused by the attack!</h3>
    <p>
      Cyber attacks can cause electrical blackouts, failure of military equipment, and breaches of national security secrets. They can result in the theft of valuable, sensitive data like medical records. They can disrupt phone and computer networks or paralyze systems, making data unavailable.
